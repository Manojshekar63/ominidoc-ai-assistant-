It first loads the dataset, preprocesses the data by selecting features and target variable, splitting into training and testing sets, standardizing the features, and training a Decision Tree Classifier. The trained model is then used to predict the species for a new sample, which is classified as setosa with an accuracy of 1.00. The program also evaluates the performance of the decision tree using accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report.",

    "answer": "Here are 10 concise bullet points:\n\n• The program uses the Iris dataset, a classic multiclass classification problem, to demonstrate the working of the decision tree based CART algorithm.\n• The dataset is loaded using the `load_iris()` function from the `sklearn.datasets` module.\n• The dataset is converted into a pandas DataFrame for easier manipulation.\n• The features and target variable are selected using the `drop()` and `assign()` functions.\n• The dataset is split into training and testing sets using the `train_test_split()` function.\n• The features are standardized using the `StandardScaler` from the `sklearn.preprocessing` module.\n• A Decision Tree classifier is trained using the CART algorithm with the `DecisionTreeClassifier` from the `sklearn.tree` module.\n• The trained model is used to predict the species for the test data.\n• The accuracy of the model is evaluated using the `accuracy_score()` function from the `sklearn.metrics` module.\n• The confusion matrix and classification report are printed to evaluate the performance of the model.",
